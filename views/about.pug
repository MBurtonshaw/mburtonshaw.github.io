        .about-bio

          p My name is Matthew Burtonshaw. I've always had a leaning toward efficiency, design, and language. But I wouldn't put this together into a set of skills as a developer before going down some other roads. Due to a love of nature, aesthetics, and science, I studied horticulture and soon started my career on a research farm; working outside daily, I grow mushrooms and vegetables of all kinds. But at a certain point I realized it wasn't necessarily my career purpose.
          
          p I want a different kind of challenge and frankly, a new position with room for career growth. I want to challenge my brain at work more than my body. So I began to learn to code. After dabbling in a few free introductory online classes, I signed up with TeamTreeHouse and have made a lot of progress. Because of the lessons I've learned there, I feel fluent in client-side JavaScript and JQuery, and have experience working on applications that mimic projects I may encounter in a future career. During this, a close friend of mine also asked me to develop a website for his new cocktail bar. That gave me a lot of very hands-on experience with a designer, and I officially had my first client. 
          
          p I'm currently in the server-side part of my classes, actively learning more about back-end programming. I'm looking to continue my journey by finding a position in a company, and with a team that is interested in helping me to further grow my skills as a developer, and I'm eager to start!
